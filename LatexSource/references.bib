abstract = {In this paper, a novel interaction framework for marker-less Augmented Reality is introduced. Model-based detection is one of the solutions for marker-less Augmented Reality. Instead of a marker, human hand is used as a distinctive object on which the augmented object placed. Leap Motion, a Virtual Reality (VR) hand tracking device, is used to detect the hand in our interaction framework for marker-less Augmented Reality. 3D hand position, gesture and direction can be obtained by using Leap Motion and passed to Unity 3d game engine. The main task for this framework is to calibrate the actual hand and the virtual hand generated by computer so that they can overlay each other. With the help of marker-less Augmented Reality Framework a user can experience intuitive interaction with virtual object and natural occlusion which will be the core functionality for next generation game, education, user interface and industrial.},

abstract = {The AirFlute is an interactive and less-expensive alternative to traditional music lessons. AirFlute uses the Leap Motion Controller within a web browser to track how a student moves their fingers in 3-dimensional physical space. Each movement of the student (e.g., moving or bending a finger) is visualized on the virtual flute display within a web browser and the corresponding note is played through the computer's speaker. By expressing a correct fingering, a student can simulate playing a note on the flute without a physical instrument. AirFlute has three main features: 1) a place for users to free play music, 2) a tutorial for users to learn note fingerings, and 3) a capability for users to practice exercises and receive feedback. This brief abstract summarizes the motivation and implementation of AirFlute as a research application in human-computer interaction. AirFlute has the potential to broaden participation in music performance for students who may not be able to afford a physical instrument.},
