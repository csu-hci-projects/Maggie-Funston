        <h1>Abstract</h1>
        <p> Virtual Instruments using gesture based technology are becoming increasingly popular.  This paper aims to explore the possibility of replacing physical pianos with motion sensor virtual ones in K-12 schools because of extensive budget cuts.</p>
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>With the advancement of technology, we have been able to change not only the way we access music, but the way we listen to it as well.  Advances in technology have also allowed us to change the way we play music.  The early 1990’s marks the start of virtual reality musical instruments. hile virtual reality has existed for a long time, it wasn’t until recently that virtual reality has exploded and become significantly more advanced.  Gesture recognition technology, often used alongside VR, is becoming more advanced as well.  Because these technologies are becoming so advanced, they are aiding in the accessibility and popularity of virtual reality instruments.  Building virtual instruments using the Leap Motion Controller has the potential to help school districts give their students access to the music programs that have been cut across the country.&nbsp;</p>
        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <p>Participants were asked to play a physical piano, a virtual piano, and take a survey that gathered information about their past experiences with musical instruments.  The survey also asked about their experience playing a virtual piano in comparison to a real one.</p>
        <h1>Results</h1>
        <p>It seems that with some improvements surrounding the motion sensor, and its placement and sensitivity, the piano could be used in K-12 schools.&nbsp;</p>
